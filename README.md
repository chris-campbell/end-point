# uppoint

Uppoint was made to solidify my understanding of using web sockets in a React and Node application. When researching socket.io's usage in applications, there is an abundance of tutorials teaching you how to make a chat application. But I wanted to learn another way of implementing sockets. For example, sending real-time notices to a specific user or even multiple specific users at any given time.

## Obstacles

Sockets, in general, aren't too complicated to understand, however like most things in programming when you need to apply learned concepts to real-world practices is where you will find the challenge. This is because the mission isn't just to get it working but to use best practices, such as keeping your code DRY or keeping the performance optimal.

I had to overcome my learning curve for using sockets while at the same time trying to maintain a clean coding environment. I will admit there is always more that can be done, however for a project I working on in my after hours I had a lot of fun banging my head against the wall :face_with_spiral_eyes:

- Built a Restful API for managing user and alert end points using express server.
- Implement Passport middleware to handle user authentication.
- Handled user sessions using express-sessions and MongoDb Sessions.
- Established a bidirectional connection between client and server to create a real-time experience.
- Utilized React context to allow access to user object throughout application.
